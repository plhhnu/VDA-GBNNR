VDA-GBNNR
Code 1 is the code for model performance evaluation. Here, only the code for the model in dataset 3 is given. To run datasets 1 and 2, you only need to replace the address of dataset 3 with that of dataset 1 and 2.
Code 2 is the code for selecting model parameters, using the grid search algorithm. Here, only the running code of dataset 3 is given, and datasets 1 and 2 only need to rewrite the address in the corresponding position.
For the dataset folder, there are three datasets, and each dataset file contains three files. Sm_s represents the chemical structure similarity data information of drugs, sm_v represents the virus-drug association information, and v_s represents the sequence similarity data information of drugs.
The Accession-number-all 3 datasets folder contains three subfolders, each containing the Accession-number of the virus and the drug respectively.
